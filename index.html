        <p>Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was one of the most famous and important mathematicians in French History.  As founder of the three laws of motion, Newton has set up the future from his time. Examples today that were created thanks to these laws are space travel, sports like bowling and basketball, and simulating car collisions.</p>

            <p>Isaac was born in Lincoln-shrine, England in the year of 1643 and was named after his father who died three months ago. In 1661, Isaac started his undergraduate studies at Trinity College, Cambridge when the Scientific Revolution occurred.  When Newton received his bachelor’s degree in 1665, the plague arrived in Europe.  Spending most of his time at home for the next two years, Newton continued to develop his undergraduate work from college. When Trinity College reopened in 1667, Newton was elected to be a fellowship at the college which was when his scientific discoveries was finally noticed by the world.</p>

                <p3>Newton was the original developer of calculus, which is an advanced branch of mathematics. Its main purpose is to solve rates of change and problems that determines areas or volumes within lines.</p3>

                    <p3>When he was a university student, Isaac started to study the sight and behavior of light. By using a prism, he discovered the existence of individual rays of light that refract at different angles, creating rainbows.</p3>

                        <p3>Newton proposed that planetary orbits are elliptical is because of the sun’s gravitation. After being questioned by British astronomer Edmond Halley, Newton gathered his findings in a tract called De Motu (On Motion).</p3>
